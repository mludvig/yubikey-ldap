YubiKey schema for LDAP
=======================

* What? Why?
------------

PAM authentication with YubiKey requires a list of YubiKey IDs
for each user who is allowed to login. Typically in the form of
a system file, for example /etc/yubikeys with entries similar to
these:

    joe.user:abcdefgh1234:xyzxyz123456:...
    some.one:hgfedcba9876:hijklmnopqrs:...

The pam_yubico module is then used with authfile=/etc/yubikeys
parameter:

    auth require pam_yubico.so authfile=/etc/yubikeys ...

That works well for one or two servers. However once you begin
deploying YubiKey authentication across a handful or more servers
you soon realise that a manual synchronisation of /etc/yubikeys
file is PITA.

Since you already authenticate your users against LDAP it would
only make sense to keep these YubiKey IDs in LDAP as well,
together with all other user details.

Sadly there seems to be no "official" LDAP schema provided by
Yubico, the company behind YubiKeys. Their official stance, as of
the time of this writing, is to store the YubiKey IDs in one of
the unused LDAP attributes. What? Seriously?

Search no more. Follow the instructions below to _cleanly_ add
YubiKey IDs to your LDAP database:

    dn: uid=joe.user,ou=People,cn=example,cn=com
    objectClass: posixAccount
    objectClass: yubiKeyUser
    objectClass: ...
    uid: joe.user
    ...
    yubiKeyId: abcdefgh1234
    yubiKeyId: xyzxyz123456

_This_ is the way to keep the YubiKey IDs in LDAP. Not through
exploiting some 'department' or 'favouriteColour' attribute, OMG!


* Installation - OLC aka cn=config
----------------------------------

Have you already migrated your LDAP server to OLC aka OnLine
Configuration aka cn=schema? If you did your job is easy:

    ~$ ldapadd -W -x -D cn=admin,cn=config -f yubikey.ldif
          adding new entry "cn=yubikey,cn=schema,cn=config"

(substitute cn=admin with whatever your cn=config RootDN is)

To be sure it worked check out this new file:
/etc/openldap/slapd.d/cn=config/cn=schema/cn={*}yubikey.ldif


* Installation - slapd.conf
---------------------------

If you are still using the ancient slapd.conf based config and
can't be bothered to meet the 21st century, well, here are the
instructions:

1) Copy yubikey.schema to /etc/openldap/schema/
   (make sure it's got the same permissions and if SELinux
    context [if used] as the other files in that directory).

2) Open /etc/openldap/slapd.conf and locate the section with
   schema includes. Add yubikey.schema at the end:
       include  /etc/openldap/schema/yubikey.schema

3) Restart the slapd daemon.

* Installation - OpenDJ or Sun Directory Server
-----------------------------------------------

Copy the yubikey-SunDS.ldif file under the schema directory
<Instance>/config/schema/05-yubikey.ldif
Restart the directory server.


* Figure out the YubiKey ID
---------------------------

This is very simple - insert YubiKey to your USB slot, open a
text editor and touch the key. You'll see something like:

    abcdefgh1234uunnvfjueirijbtkneubfdefgddkgflv
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first 12 characters are the ID: abcdefgh1234
Simple as that.


* Storing the YubiKey IDs
-------------------------

Now that we've got the yubico schema installed it's time to
store some keys. There are two steps involved:

1) Add 'objectClass: yubiKeyUser' to each .. well .. YubiKey User
   object.
2) Store his YubiKey IDs to .. well .. yubiKeyID attributes

(Quite a self-explanatory naming, isn't it? ;)

You can indeed use your LDAP manager of choice, or rely on the
classic proven command line tools as we do here.

Open yubikey-add.ldif and enter the following few lines (change
the dn: and they yubiKeyId: values of course!):

    #
    # Sample LDIF that stores two YubiKey IDs to uid=joe.user
    #
    dn: uid=joe.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
    changetype: modify
    add: objectClass
    objectClass: yubiKeyUser
    -
    add: yubiKeyId
    yubiKeyId: abcdefgh1234
    yubiKeyId: xyzxyz123456

(no indentation, each line must start at the beginning of the row)

Now run 'ldapmodify' to make the changes:
    ~# ldapmodify -W -x -D cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com -f yubikey-add.ldif
          modifying entry "uid=joe.user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"

Verify with ldapsearch:

    ~# ldapsearch -W -x -D cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com '(uid=joe.user)'

          dn: uid=joe.user,ou=People,cn=example,cn=com
          objectClass: posixAccount
          objectClass: yubiKeyUser
          objectClass: ...
          uid: joe.user
          ...
          yubiKeyId: abcdefgh1234
          yubiKeyId: xyzxyz123456


* Using it in PAM
-----------------

Again this change is very simple. Simply replace authfile= with
the LDAP parameters, i.e. from:

    auth require pam_yubico.so authfile=/etc/yubikeys ...

To (ideally all on one line):

    auth require pam_yubico.so                  \
          ldap_uri=ldap://ldap.example.com/     \
          ldapdn=ou=People,dc=example,dc=com    \
          user_attr=uid                         \
          yubi_attr=yubiKeyId ...

That's it. Try to SSH to the target system as joe.user, enter the
password immediately followed by the YubiKey and you should be
logged in :)


* Troubleshooting
-----------------

If things don't quite work as expected check the following:

- Is SELinux enabled? Are egress firewalls enabled?
  Note that for YubiCloud authentication the server daemon (e.g.
  sshd) has to make a HTTPS connection to the YubiCloud servers.
  Firewalls or SELinux may prevent it to do that.

- Can the SSH server connect to LDAP server?
  Again, there could be a firewall, broken DNS, etc.

- Can each user read its yubiKeyId LDAP attributes?
  Your LDAP access control lists (ACL) may prevent that (by
  default they shouldn't but check that with ldapsearch logging
  in as uid=joe.user.

- Temporarily add 'debug' at the end of pam_yubico parameters
  list. It will spit out a lot of potentially useful debug
  informations.
